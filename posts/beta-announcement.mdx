# Announcing the OTTO Beta

It is about time OTTO reaches the next stage, and so we have started working towards a beta release! The goal of the beta is to have a fully working, but not fully featured OTTO, with a BOM, schematics and guides available to build. We are hoping that people will get together in groups to order components, but don't plan to facilitate this ourselves.

The beta is targeted for release on our third anniversary, february 21st 2020.

As mentioned, neither the hardware or the software will have all the features we intend for the final OTTO to have. Most notably on the hardware side, there will be no power/battery management, so it will require a 5V power input. It will be DIY with SMD soldering (large components, though, so it will be fairly easy). We are hoping to put most things on a single PCB to keep complexity down, and try to make it in a way such that some of it can be machine-assembled by the vendor if one so wishes.

The main goal here, is to have fully working OTTOs out "in the field", and include you in the beta testing. Your feedback will be extremely important to us, as it will help us design new features, and decide where we need to focus our work. Also, the beta testers can help create presets and sample packs.

For now, the best way to help us, is to support us over on [patreon](/patreon). These funds go directly towards paying for test boards etc.

## Overview of the beta features

- Simple sequencer and sampler
  - "Simple" means just the basics of a step sequencer, and limited sample editing
- 3-5 synth engines
  - Rhodes
  - Goss
  - OTTO.FM
  - Maybe: Potion (wavetable)
  - Maybe: A subtractive analogue-style synth jonatan is working on
- 3 FX Engines
  - Chorus
  - Wormhole (reverb)
  - Delay
- 2 Arp engines
  - Euclid
  - Arpeggiator
- Master processing: Compression
- External in passthrough, possibly with FX sends

Most of this is already implemented to some extend, but a lot of it still needs to be finished, and all of it needs some cleanup. We are currently working on these things, and if you want to get involved, head on over to the [discord](/discord). A point where we specifically want some help, is cleaning up the graphics.

Another thing we want to focus on for the beta (probably mostly towards the end), is manuals, documentation, guides, walkthrough videos etc. This is another point where we are going to want the help of the community.

We hope you are as excited for this as we are!
