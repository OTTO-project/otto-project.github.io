C++ Guidelines
==============

## clang-format

For consistent formatting, we use `clang-format`. The repo contains a `.clang-format` file, and `clang-format` should be run on every file before each commit. We recommend getting an integration for your editor, plugins should be available for most.

In the future, we will set up CI to not accept incorrectly formatted code!

## Doxygen documentation comments

We strive to add doxygen-style documentation comments to all declarations. There _is_ an [auto-generated doxygen site](https://otto-project.github.io/OTTO/) for the latest develop branch, but the most important use of these comments is in-code documentation, and in-editor documentation popups. Our preferred documentation comment style is `///`, and `@` for doxygen commands:

```cpp
/// Triggers a new voice. 
/// 
/// @param midi_note base frequency.
/// @param detune is multiplied on frequency
/// @param legato controls legato on envelope + on_note_on. 
///        If `true`, `on_note_on` will not be called.
/// @param jump controls legato for portamento
///        If `true`, portamento will not be applied.
void trigger(int midi_note, float detune, float velocity, bool legato, bool jump) noexcept;
```

## `noexcept` everything on audio thread

Everything on the audio thread _has_ to be `noexcept`, and in general, it should be used as much as possible. Get used to using `noexcept` by default, and only omitting it when explicitly using exceptions.

## Range-based implementations of standard algorithms

We have range-based implementations of all standard algorithms available in `util/algorithms.hpp`. These should be preferred over the iterator based versions whenever possible.

```cpp
auto found = util::find_if(voices, [&] (auto& v) { return v.midi_note() == note; });
if (found != voices.end()) {
  // do things
}
```
