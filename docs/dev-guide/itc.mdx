# Inter-Thread Communication

> In practice, this is mostly used with the [props](props) library, but it is important to understand the basics of how it works

A central part of the OTTO software, is the communication between threads. This is implemented in the `otto::itc` namespace, of which the basic contents are described below.


## Actions

Actions are at the center of the inter-thread communication model used in OTTO. The are the "packages" that are sent between threads.

An action is defined as a type alias to `itc::Action<Tag, Args...>` where `Tag` is a unique tag type per action, and `Args...` is an arbitrary number of arguments passed with the action.

```cpp
struct Actions {
  /// Set the sample buffer.
  /// Sent whenever the sample buffer should change.
  /// @param buffer the location of the new sample data. Allocated from the audio pool.
  using set_sample_buffer = itc::Action<struct set_sample_buffer_tag, gsl::span<float>>;
  //    ~~~~~~~ A ~~~~~~~               ~~~~~~~~~~~ B ~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~ C ~~~~~~
  
  using reset = itc::Action<struct reset_tag>;
  //    ~ A ~               ~~~~~~ B ~~~~~~~
};
```

In the action defined above, the action has the name (`A`) `set_sample_buffer`. The unusual syntax at `B` declares a tag type `set_sample_buffer_tag`, which will never be defined. Since the tag type is only used to differentiate the action types, this type is never used for anything else

User-defined actions are usually defined in an Actions struct in the engine namespace, but most actions are sent by properties.

## Action Receivers

Actions are received and handled by _action receivers_. These are classes that extend `itc::ActionReceiver<...>` (or usually `itc::ActionReceiverOnBus<Bus, ...>`), where `...` can be either

 - a single action type (`Action<Tag, Args...>`)
 - multiple action types
 - a `meta::list` of action types
 - a (nested) combination of the above.

When implementing an action receiver, one must implement the virtual handler function `action(Action<Tag, Args...>, Args...)` for each action in the action list.

#### Example:
```cpp
struct Audio final : itc::ActionReceiver<Actions::set_sample_buffer, Actions::reset> {
  
  void action(Actions::set_sample_buffer, gsl::span<float> buffer) noexcept final;
  void action(Actions::reset) noexcept final;
}
```

<Note>

Always mark action handlers as `final`, and preferably the whole class as well. Avoid using an inheritance hierarchy of receivers if possible, and consider [composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance) instead.

</Note>


One can check whether a class `T` is an action receiver for the action `A` using the type trait `itc::is_action_receiver_v<T, A>`.

## ActionBus

To receive actions, a receiver must be registered on a bus. The bus contains a runtime registry of receivers for each action, and a queue of actions to send to all registered receivers. The cannonical way to register a receiver, is by extending `itc::ActionReceiverOnBus<BusTag, Actions...>` instead of `itc::ActionReceiver<Actions...>`. This class registers and unregisters itself on the bus identified by `BusTag` for all `Actions...`, and supports the same types for the `Actions...` parameter.

Currently, the OTTO contains 3 busses, identified by the following three tag types:

 - `itc::AudioBus`: Queued actions are handled on the audio thread before each new audio buffer.
 - `itc::GraphicsBus`: Queued actions are handled on the GUI thread before each frame.
 - `itc::LogicBus`: Queued actions are handled on the main logic thread in a continuous event loop.
 
One can send actions directly to one or more busses using the `itc::send_to_bus<Busses...>(Action, Args...)` function. The `Busses...` parameter pack follows the same convention as the `Actions...` paramter to `ActionReceiver`, that is, it can be any nested combination of bus tag types and lists of these.

<Note>

  Most actions are sent by [properties](props), which by default send to the audio and graphics busses
