Writing Engines
===============

Engines is the term for the Arpeggiators, Synthesizers and Audio effects in OTTO. There is one slot for an active arpeggiator, one slot for a synthesizer, and two slots for active audio effects. The signal flow always has the arpeggiator going into the synth. The audio effects function as effects busses, meaning that everything in OTTO that makes sound can be routed to the effects in various amounts.

For the arpeggiator and the audio effect slots, there is a specific "null-engine" that corresponds to an inactive slot.

An engine is split in three parts:
- The Engine struct, usually named for the engine, e.g. `Goss` or `Wormhole`. This contains the `Properties` which are basically the "engine settings" that are changed with the encoder input and serialized for saving either when shutting down OTTO or for presets, etc. The encoder input is also handed by this struct. Refer to the Developer Guide for more info.
- The `Audio` struct which runs on the audio thread. This owns everything that has to do with handling MIDI events and generating audio. 
- The `Screen` struct which runs on the graphics thread. This owns everything having to do with drawing the graphics on the screen.
