# OTTO Yocto Development

The OTTO linux distro is built using yocto, and based on [poky](https://www.yoctoproject.org/software-item/poky/) . The root board support package is available on github [](https://github.com/otto-project/otto-bsp)

# Description
otto-bsp is intended to provide developers of the OTTO synth an easy to setup environment for OpenEmbedded/Yocto project development. This respository is set up with git submodules to link together all of the required BSP layers.

# Getting started with an existing Linux system
If you already have a linux system available for development, the dependencies for development are as follows:
```
gawk wget git-core diffstat unzip texinfo gcc-multilib build-essential chrpath socat libsdl1.2-dev xterm
```

Once those are installed, you are ready to download the source:
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/OTTO-project/otto-bsp.git
```

Once the source is downloaded, you are ready to set up your local build directory and initiate a build:
```
MACHINE=otto-beta-v0.1.0 DISTRO=otto source setup-environment build
bitbake otto-image-dev
```
The `MACHINE` environment variable corresponds roughly to iterations of the hardware - changing things such as pin layout and peripherals. Currently, this is the most recent version.  Building the `-dev` image includes an SSH server ond some development tools. If this is not needed, you can `bitbake otto-image`.
Relative to the build folder, your compiled image will be located at
```
build/tmp/deploy/images/otto-beta-v0.1.0/otto-image-dev-otto-beta-v0.1.0.wic
```
This image can be flashed to your SD card with the following command (where /dev/sdX is your sdcard), executed from the build folder:
```
sudo dd if=tmp/deploy/images/otto-beta-v0.1.0/otto-image-dev-otto-beta-v0.1.0.wic of=/dev/sdX bs=1M && sync
```
At this point, the OTTO should be able to boot. The `wic` tool also works with [bmap](https://github.com/intel/bmap-tools) which should be faster than `dd`. You are welcome to try this out.

# Getting started without an existing Linux system
If you do not already have a linux system available for development, the Yocto project has been tested to work on Ubuntu 20.04 on Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2), which allow you to proceed as above.

Some dependencies that were assumed to be included above, might not be included from this approach. This should become apparent through the process. 

You might not find your SD card in /dev/sdX, but you can use a program like BalenaEtcher to flash your SD-card. Note that you will need to flash the most recent build:  `otto-image-otto-beta-v0.1.0-SOMEDATEANDVERSION.rootfs.wic` and you cannot just flash `otto-image-dev-otto-beta-v0.1.0.wic` since this is a symlink and Windows does not always resolve these.

## Connecting to wifi

To connect the OTTO to WiFi over command line:

1. Start connmanctl interactive shell:

```
connmanctl
```

2. Enable WiFi and scan for access points. Wait for a response from the program before performing additional commands. Scanning and connecting take some time.

```
connmanctl> enable wifi
Enabled wifi
connmanctl> scan wifi
Scan completed for wifi
```

3. List access points and connect to the "service" matching your Wifi SSID. Tab autocomplete works on service names.

```
connmanctl> services
  <Your SSID>    wifi_<blahblahblah>_<blahblahblah>_managed_psk
connmanctl> agent on
Agent registered
connmanctl> connect wifi_<blahblahblah>_<blahblahblah>_managed_psk
Passphrase? <your WiFi passphrase>
Connected wifi_<blahblahblah>_<blahblahblah>_managed_psk
```


## Using devtool

Devtool is useful for making modifications to some code, cross compiling, then deploying to the target to test without having to recompile the image. Here's how you'd normally use it for something like otto-core:

1. First make sure your bitbake environment is set up and you are in your build folder (see above first if you do not know what this means):
```
source setup-environment build
```

2. Create a local source directory of the recipe you want to modify.
```
devtool modify otto-core
```

3. Modify the source in build/workspace/sources/otto-core

4. Build the source
```
devtool build otto-core
```
5. Make sure your target system is on and connected to the internet. See [Connecting to WiFi](#connecting-to-wifi) page for more information. You can get the IP address by running
```
hostname -i
```
from the target.

6. Deploy the application to the target
```
devtool deploy-target -s otto-core root@<ip_address>
```
