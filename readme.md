# OTTO Documentation / blog

# Contributing

To get running locally, clone this repository, and run

```sh
yarn install
```
in the root folder.

Then, to run the auto-refreshing development server, run

```sh
yarn develop
```

This will open a local version of the site to `localhost:8000`, which auto refreshes on file saves.

Edit files in the `docs/` folder for documentation, and add blogposts in `posts/`
